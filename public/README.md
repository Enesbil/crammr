# Sample PDF Files

This directory should contain sample PDF files for the demo:

- `NimratNotes.pdf` - High-quality calculus notes (approved reference)
- `Enes1.pdf` - Student-submitted notes for comparison
- `york1.pdf` - Course syllabus for comparison

## Note for Setup

To run the full demo, you'll need to add these PDF files to this directory. 
The application references these files for:

1. **PDF Viewing**: Displaying notes in the custom PDF viewer
2. **AI Analysis**: Comparing submitted notes against approved materials and syllabus
3. **Chat Context**: Providing AI with document context for answering questions

## Security Note

These PDF files are not included in this DevPost submission to keep the package size manageable.
In a production deployment, you would store these files in a cloud storage service like AWS S3 or similar.
